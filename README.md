# Dolce Theme

This is a work in progress, creating a theme for Massive Wiki Builder.

It's inspired by the double hamburger menu system used by Wikipedia in [Vector 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vector_2022).

The development approach has been to iterate on prompts to ChatGPT. As of this writing, it's still a work in progress, it's not quite all working correctly.

See [[Prompt]] for the description of the page mechanics. Caveat lector, the prompt will continue to evolve. (The editing will continue until morale improves!)

The collapsible sections in Vector 2022 have cool `hide` / `move to sidebar` buttons in their header lines. Those are not yet represented in the prompt.

The current hamburger icon is just HTML `&#9776;`, but the two icons need to be different. Vector 2022 uses these:

- <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/OOUI_icons#menu> (for main menu)
- <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/OOUI_icons#listBullet> (for contents)

When the mechanics are working better, then we'll get to some styling for appearance.

More to come...
